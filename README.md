# 1. Introduction
![](https://img.unocero.com/2019/03/javascript.jpg)
Javascript is an Object-oriented Programming Language. As I quote from the ebook from which I have benefit a lot `You don't know JS, yet. Neither do I, not fully anyway. None of us do. But we can all start getting to know JS better.`

Javascript has it wierd part. It is not multi-thread language. It has some bizarre design of the data store structure(although it is still an Object-oriented language). There are a lots of pitfalls That We might fall into easily. 

This Project aims to tackle the tricky part of Javascript by spelling out some key points in Javascript, i.e. inheritance Chain, 

It also belongs to  `Code with James` Project, so the corresponding videos can be found in my channel in [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrBUBSCT4ds02d4id3DBWwA/playlists). As video is a more intuitive way to learn and share knowledge, please feel free to leave any comment in my channel and subscribe to always get the latest contents.
